# xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
## NOTE: This fork basically rips out grim and inserts wayshot in it's place. We should probably collaborate with upstream to integrate both projects.

[xdg-desktop-portal] backend for wlroots using wayshot

## Building

```sh
meson build
ninja -C build
```

## Installing

### From Source

```sh
ninja -C build install
```

### Distro Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr.svg)](https://repology.org/project/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/versions)


## Running

Make sure `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` is set. Make sure `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and
`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` are imported into D-Bus. If you're running Sway, this
can be added to your config file:

    exec dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway

When correctly installed, xdg-desktop-portal should automatically invoke
xdg-desktop-portal-wlr when needed.

### Configuration

See `man 5 xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`.

### Manual startup

At the moment, some command line flags are available for development and
testing. If you need to use one of these flags, you can start an instance of
xdpw using the following command:

```sh
xdg-desktop-portal-wlr -r [OPTION...]
```

To list the available options, you can run `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr --help`.
